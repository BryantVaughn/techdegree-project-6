# Wheel of Success

This is the 6th project of the Treehouse Techdegree to practice with JavaScript. This is a word guessing game similar to Wheel of Fortune where you get 5 lives to try and guess the letters of the phrase. I used DOM manipulation to dynamically update the page as the user interacted with the game.

### Challenges

My biggest challenges with this project were code layout and keeping the code DRY. I tried utilizing functions to keep everything modular, but had some trouble deciding how to structure all functions.
